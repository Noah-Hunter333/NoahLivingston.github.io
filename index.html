                <p>Hello, I'm Noah, a first-year junior developer studying at NSCC. I enjoy working on projects and designing the style and layout of websites. I also enjoy solving problems and building intuitive user experiences, no matter what device you may use.<p>
                <p>I have some experience with JavaScript, basic networking, and administration also have worked on projects such as setting up virtual machines with basic bash scripts, making a calculator in JavaScript, and the website that you are looking at right now.</p>
                <p>Outside of development and programming, I am a passionate guitar player and teacher. I also enjoy studying philosophy and crafting coffee-style drinks.
