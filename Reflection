Reflection piece: 
my website hasn't changed too much just made some changes to the to the navegatin menu and also added a proper back to top of the page button. A lot of the chanllenge was trying to add the logo to the header because of some of the sizes of the divs made it diffecult to center it properly. 
other then the logo it's relatively the same just made some few changes so it fit's better on a desktop. 
when it's in desktop view it has nevagtion at the top and when it's sized down to mobile view it goes back to the burger menu that we hade on our mobile site.
